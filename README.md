# Anomaly-Detection-in-Smart-Home-IoT-Networks
Designed an online unsupervised anomaly detection system for smart home IoT networks using CluStream for micro-clustering and Page-Hinkley Test for concept drift detection.

Implemented traffic stream analysis on TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets to detect attacks in real time with 97% detection rate and 87%+ precision.

Addressed limitations of batch models by enabling real-time, adaptive, low-latency detection without labeled datasets.

Evaluated model on public IoT datasets with protocol-specific stream segmentation and clustering visualizations.
